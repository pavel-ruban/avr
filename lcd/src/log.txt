-	removed unused FAT_readRoot
.	Compilation size is 13380

28 May
*	Fixed Playback by removing optomization in FAT_NextCluster

25 May 
!	playback broken after optimizing code 

17 May

!	Current source is too big to use a bootloader.

13 May
-	Removed FAT16_get label to save space

	NOKIA_ALTPINOUT in pcd8544.h
	
22 Mar
+	Added very basic Directory support
!	Directory support doesn't work yet.

6 Mar

+	Added Richs update to the NOKIA code
+	Added Rich's ID3 code
~	Volume is only adjusted during playback

VERSION 0.4

20 Feb 2006
*	fixed display bugs with volume & stat display.

18 Feb
+	Added facility to display stats for x seconds 
+	Added display of battery voltage on wake up with no MMC.
+	Added auto shutdown and write to eeprom on low voltage
+	Added no startup on low battery
~	moved main timer callback to main.c
*	fixed power off timeout when no mmc.

15 Feb
*	fixed lfn bug ( lfn_entry delclared as 8bit ->16bit needed)
!	scanning is munted with mmc on startup
+	Added "Scanning..." on display while looking for mp3s.
+	Added some ADC routines to main.c and button.c
+	Added checking of voltage every N seconds

12 Feb
*	Repeat all works this time. no really it does. (fixed off by one error)
.	Added chksum func for proper lfn support.

11	Feb
+	Added FAT16_entryMIN to record first good song
+	Added SCAN_JUMPTOSTART to allow wrapping around from start->end/ end->start 
	of files when scaning through. 
.	works but Filenames are VRY flakey. Need to move LFN handling out of 
	FAT_Readroot and into new function that works properly.

10 Feb
*	Fixed repeat all/ file scan
.	consider adding a FAT16_entryMIN var to hold first good MP3.

9 Feb
.	fixed eeprom save/load bugs
!	Filenames are STILL Broken in reverse
!	Long delays when scanning MMC.
*	prev and next file work again (names do not)

23 Jan 2006
!	Broken file search functions
+	Moved all power control funtions to power.c/h
+	Moved all EEPROM functions into eeprom.c/h
+	moved all file System funtions into avrfat16.c/h

21 Jan 2006
~	Power off now goes into "power down" mode and resumes with up on Joystick press
.	If joystick down is sensed then the bootloader is run to allow updating of the software.
.	Settings are written to eeprom only when entering bootloader.
.	This should save power in "off" mode and save uneeded writes to eeprom.
.	Up on joystick will always wake no matter if in powerdown or bootloader.
~	Moved file search routines into GetNextSong GetPrevSong Routines.

15 Jan 2006
+	Added High Endurance EEPROM (Atmel AN AVR101)

14 Jan 2006
+	Added Volume and song to saving to EEPROM
+	Added Play time timer
-	Removed OSCCAL function.

VERSION 0.3

03 Jan 2006
.	Tested current code with mp3s @ 128kbps, 160kbps, 192kbps & 320kbps
+	added timeout and powerdown after <AUTOPOWEROFF_TIMEOUT> seconds
*	occasional lock ups after last song
*	repeat all mode now works.
*	pressing down now switches off even when started with no MMC.

23 Dec 2005

8 Nov 2005
*	Fixed file offset bug in avrfat16.c
~	change MMC read to quick exit on repeat read (poor mans caching)
.	attempting to skip iD3 tags --> scramblomatic

6 Nov 2005
+	added code to detect ID3 tags at the start of a file
	(doesn't work file start seems to be offset 1200Hex for first file.)
!	SW MMC detect works but resets to no MMC after a few seconds of play back
	(with 192Kbs VBR tracks)
.	SW detection not needed if R2 is 1Meg all cards should be supported.
